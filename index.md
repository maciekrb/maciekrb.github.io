I'm an enthusiastic web application architect / developer, passionate for creating innovative tools and applications. I know one thing or two about web architectures and logic/data separation models, MV\*, separation of concerns and application scalability. 

I'm passionate for end user product development, love to find new and better ways to accomplish old things. I'm kind of friendly, and enjoy working with other people full of new ideas and initiative.  I can mock-up, architect and build any kind of web based application / API from the groud up, or guide a team of designers / developers through the construction process of a web app, in which case I still love to be *hands on* and collaborate as much as possible. 

I have been writting web applications for the last 12 years using Perl and PHP with Linux/BSD, but now I prefer Python if given the luxury of choice, and much newer technologies for front end development such as Backbone.js, Angular.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis.io, Google's BigTable, Google App Engine and Heroku. 

Have built applications for organizations including United Nations, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Colombian National Radio and Television, Transporte Masivo de Panamá, Colombian National Parks, Von Humboldt institute. Have a background in content management systems, e-commerce, customer loyalty, vehicle tracking systems and applications requiring to store big amounts of data.

I've been self employed for about 8 years. Have both, failed and succeeded in my own entrepreneurial adventures, and I won't stop doing it because I really love what I do.
