I'm an enthusiastic web application architect / developer, passionate for creating innovative tools and applications. I like thinking in advance about things such as separation of concerns and application scalability. I love end user product development, and enjoy finding new and better ways to accomplish old things. I'm kind of friendly, and like working with proactive people willing to bounce concepts and ideas.  I can mock-up, architect and build different kinds of applications or APIs from the groud up, or guide a team of designers / developers through the thing, in which case I still love to be *hands on* and collaborate where fit. 

I have been writting web applications for the last 12 years using `Perl` and `PHP` with Linux/BSD, nowadays I prefer `Python` if given the luxury of choice, and much newer technologies such as `Backbone.js`, `Angular.js`, `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, `Redis.io`, and other cool cloud based thingies such as `Google's BigTable`, `Google App Engine` and `Heroku`. 

Have built applications for organizations including **United Nations**, **Chevron**, **Coca-Cola**, **Colombian National Radio and Television**, **Transporte Masivo de Panamá**, **Colombian National Parks**, **Von Humboldt institute** and many other individuals and organizations. Have a background in content management systems, e-commerce, customer loyalty, vehicle tracking systems and applications requiring to store big amounts of data.

I've been self employed for about 8 years. Have both, failed and succeeded in my own entrepreneurial adventures, and most likely I won't stop doing it because I really love what I do.

My enthusiasm for coding hasn't stopped me from having a degree in Biology and playing music with 3 wonderful musicians and human beings: David Giraldo, Arturo Gonzalez and Juan David Garzon, whith whom I've shared the luxury of playing in **Antipoda**.
